### Creative Juices

**Status:** ðŸš§ Under active development

Break free from predictable AI responses with randomized creative prompts.

**Use when:**
- Need inspiration or fresh perspectives
- Stuck on design/feature problems
- Want to validate assumptions or reality-check ideas

**Three tools:**
1. `get_inspiration` - Gentle creative nudges with everyday metaphors
2. `think_outside_the_box` - Intense creative shocks with dramatic scenarios
3. `reality_check` - Strategic validation using Elon Musk's frameworks
