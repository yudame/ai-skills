## Design Philosophy

### Why These Words?

1. **Concrete over Abstract**: "baking-shoe" forces metaphorical thinking more than "crystallize-entropy"
2. **Historical Span**: Primitive → ancient → modern → futuristic maximizes metaphorical range
3. **Tangible and Sensory**: Physical objects and actions create stronger mental imagery
4. **Balanced Intensity**: Gentle mode for starting, intense mode for breaking through blocks

### Usage Guidelines

- **Randomize freely**: The larger the conceptual gap, the stronger the creative effect
- **Don't filter**: Even "weird" combinations often spark the best insights
- **Combine across categories**: Mix ancient with futuristic, natural with technological
- **Trust the process**: Initial confusion often leads to breakthrough insights
